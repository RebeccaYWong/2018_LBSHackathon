            <p> Rebecca helped us a lot during the adoption event on Sunday. She organized a campaign on social media and made sure that a lot of people interested in adopting a puppy would come. Thanks, Rebecca!</p>

        <p> Hugo came in earlier than expected, helped us prepare the food and then stayed 20 minutes later to help us wash the dishes. He also was very cheerful while serving food, it definitely made a better day for everyone who came for a bowl of soup. Definitely 5 stars! </p>

        <p> It was great to see all those puppies go home with family. All the guys in Dogâ€™s trust were really helpful and made me feel welcomed. Can wait for next Saturday! </p>

        <p> Going to Acton homeless concern was a lot of fun! All the staff in there was very welcoming and care a lot about their cause. We served around 200 people that afternoon. Will definitely come back! </p>
